PATCHWORK WITH NEON
===================

This document is a modified version of the PATCHWORK document I wrote for
Link.

I. SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT

	Grab the tarball of the release you are targeting your 
	patch towards from the ariston.dev FTP server.

	Usually, you will end up editing multiple files (if not,
	skip this section) so you should extract the tarball into
	two separate folders; one for development and the other
	as a vanilla tree so we can use it to compare against.

		$ gzip -cd neon-mile1.tar.gz | tar xvf
		$ mv neon-mile1 neon-devel
		$ gzip -cd neon-mile1.tar.gz | tar xvf
		$ mv neon-mile1 neon-vanilla

	To update the folders upon a new version release, you'll
	need to delete the old neon-devel folder and get the
	patch file from the FTP server (which will be named like:
	patch-mile2) and apply it to neon-vanilla like so:

		$ rm -rf neon-devel
		$ cd neon-vanilla && patch -p1 -ipatch-mile2
		$ cd ../ && cp -r neon-vanilla/ neon-devel/

	If you only need to modify a single file, just do:

		$ cp $MYFILE $MYFILE.orig
		$ vi $MYFILE

II. UPDATING THE CHANGELOG

	The changelog format is something along the lines of this:

	Author: John Doe <john.doe@n11.dev>
	Date: # Insert date from 'date' command
	
	Added new command # basically just the commit title

	# Give a description of the whole change
	This new command does xyz.

	# Then give in-depth details on what has changed in each file
	* neon.c: Added new command to command parser
	* new-command.c: new file

III. MAKING THE PATCH FILE

	If you only edited a single file and created the .orig copy, 
	you can just do:

		$ diff -up $MYFILE{.org,} > patch

	If you did multiple files and you have the vanilla source tree,
	you need to do:

		$diff -uprN neon-vanilla neon-devel > neon-devel/patch

IV.  EDITING AND SENDING THE PATCH FILE

	To send your patch correctly, you will need to add certain
	email headers to your patch file or add them through your
	SMTP program of choice.

	The subject of the email should be:

		Subject: [PATCH neon] <commit/changelog entry name>

	Then edit your patch file to include the changelog entry
	description and your 'Signed-off-by', like so:

		# continuing to use the example from earlier
		This new command does xyz.

		* neon.c: Added new command to command parser
		* new-command.c: new file

		Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@n11.dev>

		---

		<actual patch diff starts here>

	You can then use your SMTP program of choice to send it.
	I recommend seeing EmailClients.rst in the Linux source tree
	in the Documentation/process directory for more info on email
	clients.
