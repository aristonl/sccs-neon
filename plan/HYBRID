Centralized Aspects:

    Depot-Centric Organization:
        Neon features a depot-centric organization where depots act as central
        repositories containing multiple projects.
        
        This centralized structure facilitates efficient organization and
        management of projects within a unified system.

    Centralized Access Control:
        Neon employs centralized access control mechanisms to regulate user
        permissions and ensure the security of repository data.
        
        Permissions for read, write, and execute operations are managed
        centrally, allowing administrators to enforce access policies.

    Depot-wide Versioning:
        Versioning within Neon occurs at the depot level, allowing for
        centralized tracking of changes across all projects within a depot.
        
        This centralized versioning model simplifies the management of project
        histories and facilitates repository-wide operations such as branching
        and merging.

Distributed Aspects:

    Project-Centric Development:
        Despite its depot-centric structure, Neon supports project-centric
        development by allowing users to work with individual projects within
        a depot.
        
        Users can clone specific projects from a depot to their local machines,
        enabling decentralized development workflows.

    Offline Work and Collaboration:
        Neon enables offline work and collaboration through distributed copies
        of projects.
        
        Users can clone projects locally, make changes offline, and later
        synchronize their changes with the central depot, fostering
        decentralized collaboration.

    Peer-to-Peer Communication:
        Neon facilitates peer-to-peer communication between distributed copies
        of projects, enabling direct collaboration between users.
        
        Users can exchange changesets, patches, or diffs with peers, allowing
        for seamless collaboration without relying solely on a central server.

    Branching and Merging:
        Neon supports distributed branching and merging operations, empowering
        users to work on independent branches and merge changes locally.
        
        Users can manage branching and merging operations within their local
        copies of projects, promoting decentralized development workflows.

Integration of Centralized and Distributed Models:

    Neon seamlessly integrates centralized and distributed features, offering
    users the flexibility to choose the most suitable workflow for their
    projects.
    
    By combining elements of both models, Neon provides a versatile version
    control solution that accommodates various development scenarios, from
    centralized team collaboration to decentralized individual projects.
