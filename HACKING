CONTRIBUTING TO NEON
====================

* Coding Style

The coding style used in NEON is the 'Kernel Normal Form' from the BSD's mixed
with the Linux coding style.

* Patches

In your patch, you should include a ChangeLog entry and a patch description.
You should still keep atomic commits in mind and make separate logical patches
and entries. Make sure you also *TEST* your patch before submission.

Note that submitting you patch means that your changes can be distributed
under the GNU GPLv2 and/or the BSD 3-Clause. Changes can be submitted to:
	<neon-vcs@googlegroups.com>

See docs/patchwork on how to actually create patches.
