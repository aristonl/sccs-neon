This is just the main 'TODO' file of NEON. This exists mainly to
keep track of where the project is supposed to be and what I
should be working on. Please feel free to work on anything that
isn't being currently worked on.

These tasks will also be mirrored on GitHub for easy web viewing
and collaboration.

Key:
    (N): Not done. No work currently being done.
    (W): Not done. Work is currently being done.
    (D): Done.

Quick overview of the format:

* 1 (N): Work on N/A.

	Description.

----------------------------------------------------------------

* 1 (W): Basic Command Functionality

	All we really need at the moment is just to be able to
	have basic commands (everyday commands) implemented. Not
	in the 'fully functional' way but in a 'stub' state,
	meaning you can run the commands but they won't do
	anything.*

	*: This really only applies to stuff like committing,
	logs, etc since we haven't figured out the whole file
	system format yet.

* 3 (D): Work on repository cache

* 4 (D): Create config file when init'ing the project
